<h2>CSSI's Consulting Group</h2>

    <p>Our Consulting group works with firms to optimize their entire process from reconciliation to quarterly reporting with their expertise in report writing, programming and process analysis. We assist firms by creating automated processes, data clean-up utilities, custom interfaces and extracts, reports, integrating systems and by providing detailed process reviews.</p>

   <h2>CSSI's Consulting Group</h2>

   <p>Our BackOffice Services act as a firm’s in-house operations outsourced as a reconciliation staff (or staff supplement). The services include daily account reconciliation, entry of paper statements, price and index updates and backup of audit trails and logs. CSSI administers the services remotely on the customer’s system, which allows the customer to maintain control of both the operation and the data.</p>
